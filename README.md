# rust-projectlist-tool

My first real project with Rust as programming language.

A small webapp build with Rust, Actix-Web, SeaORM and genpdf.
I also uses JQuery and Bootstrap in the browser.

I wrote it in order to capture my freelance project list, create a PDF out of it and push it to my website.
